## Salesforce Bazel OSS Contributions

This is the parent repo of the code we want to contribute to OSS.
Since each contribution is quite different in nature, each is isolated into a distinct Bazel Workspace.
This will make compliance to the Salesforce OSS process easier to manage.

Contributions:
- [bazel-springboot-rule](bazel-springboot-rule): a Bazel extension to build Spring Boot applications
